We rely on findings synthesized in the book How Learning Works: Seven Research-Based Principles for Smart Teaching (Ambrose et al., 2010). We use this text in our Instructor Trainer training program, so that Trainers (who teach our Instructor Training courses) can understand why we teach the way we do, and why our lessons are designed the way they are. The authors identify seven principles of learning (direct quotation from the book are bolded): “Students’ prior knowledge can help or hinder learning.” – Identifying what the learners know before coming to our workshops help us adjust what we teach. One way we do this is through our pre-workshop surveys. We also give the learners frequent exercises (or “challenges”) throughout our lessons, which help Instructors and learners identify and correct misconceptions. “How students organize knowledge influences how they learn and apply what they know.” – Human working memory is limited, and can only handle about five to seven separate items of information at a time. We organize our lessons to introduce a few concepts at a time, and then provide challenges to give learners an opportunity to practice using these new concepts. This lets learners build connections between new concepts and their previous knowledge and transfer this new knowledge into their long-term memory, increasing the likelihood that they will be able to use this information successfully in new contexts. “Students’ motivation determines, directs, and sustains what they do to learn.” – Our learners come to our workshops already motivated to learn the concepts we teach. They realize they need the skills we teach to conduct their research more effectively. They have experienced the pain that comes with copying and pasting data across spreadsheets, or having to re-do complex graphs over and over as new data come in. However, they may also be intimidated by how much they have to learn before being proficient programmers and data analysts. Two strategies we use to keep our learners motivated are: (1) to create a positive learning environment, and (2) to teach the most useful skills first. We teach both of these in our Instructor Training program, and discuss how they influence curricular design below. “To develop mastery, students must acquire component skills, practice integrating them, and know when to apply what they have learned.” – Our lessons use frequent challenges to provide opportunities for learners to practice applying their new skills. These challenges are designed to incrementally build on each other and integrate previous taught and new skills. Careful attention to exercise design helps assure learners will be able to transfer the skills they acquire in our workshop to their own research. “Goal-directed practice coupled with targeted feedback enhances the quality of students’ learning.” – When Learners try to solve the challenges we include in our lessons, they receive direct feedback from the computer - either an error message or the expected answer. Error messages are often opaque, and do not on their own help learners advance in their learning process, making them frustrating and demotivating. Our lessons are designed to be delivered as real-time in-person instruction, so that learners get feedback from Instructors and workshop helpers that is human-parsable and directed to their level of understanding. Furthermore, challenges used in a lesson should only require the skills that have already been introduced during the workshop, and should have a limited range of possible answers. “Students’ current level of development interacts with the social, emotional, and intellectual climate of the course to impact learning.” – Providing a positive learning environment reduces learners’ stress and helps increase their confidence in their ability to use the skills we teach. Creating this positive environment is a responsibility shared among all participants: Instructors, helpers, workshop hosts, and learners. Setting expectations by introducing our Code of Conduct at the start of each workshop, and enforcing it, contributes to making the workshop a welcoming space for everyone. Other strategies we use to create a positive learning environment are covered in our Instructor Training. Curricular content also plays a major role in creating a positive environment: examples chosen cannot be alienating, skill level must be appropriate for the audience, and the examples and challenges must be directly applicable for our learners. For instance, a learner creates a visualization that they can directly apply to their own data, it reinforces their motivation and favors a positive learning climate. “To become self-directed learners, students must learn to monitor and adjust their approaches to learning.” – In-person workshops allow Instructors to model the thinking process that is needed to address the challenges in our lessons. As an Instructor, being very explicit (“thinking aloud”) about the steps of the mental model that are involved in identifying the functions to use, the values of the arguments they take, and the order in which to call these functions to solve an exercise, helps learners to think of the questions they need to ask themselves when facing new problems to solve. While this type of approach works for any level of complexity in the challenges we teach, it works best for most advanced ones, where several steps need to be integrated to come to the solution. Before reaching this level of complexity, the challenges can be designed to guide this process, using scaffolding. Scaffolding is the process where all the pieces of code to answer the problem are already written but are not in the correct order (Parson’s problem), or fill in the blanks. This might be one of the most important things we teach in our workshops. It sets learners on a successful path for further self-directed learning. When developing the content of the curriculum, think of the kind of thinking process that is needed to successfully address the research questions in your field. In the context of a two-day workshop, not all of the principles outlined by the authors of “How Learning Works” apply. We emphasize those that create a positive, engaging experience for our participants, and that will motivate them to learn more about the best practices and skills covered in our workshops. Applying these principles effectively requires that they are incorporated into both what is taught (content) and how it is taught (delivery). Our Instructor Training program focuses on teaching Instructors how to use these principles in their teaching. In this handbook, we focus on applying these principles to curriculum design. Before starting to create lesson content, we hihgly recommend that you familiarize yourself with our Instructor Training curriculum. 2.2 Backward design Backward design is an instructional design model that starts with identifying the desired outcomes of a learning experience, including core skills and concepts that learners need to acquire. These identified outcomes are used to develop course content and assessments to measure learners’ progress towards these outcomes. This model was developed by Grant J. Wiggins and Jay McTighe in the late 1990s and is expanded on in their text Understanding by Design. We use backward design in developing our curricula because of its focus on identifying clear, measurable learning goals and providing assessments aligned with those goals. [Analogy with drawing: you want to draw the outline before filling the details.] In essense, the backward design process has three stages: Identify the practical skills we aim to teach. Design challenges to give an opportunity for our learners to practice and integrate these skills. Identify what we need to teach for our learners to acquire these skills. This approach ensures that all the skills we teach work together to meet the over-arching goals of our curriculum. It also reduces the risk that we won’t teach a concept learners need in order to be able to master the skills we aim to teach. Similarly, it avoids teaching topics that do not help us meet our goals. Reducing distractions is part of our lesson design as we strive to reduce cognitive load on learners. To this end, we also develop our lessons to be centered around a narrative and a dataset they can relate with quickly. Because our workshops are domain-specific, the data we use, and the type of questions we ask with the data are already somewhat familiar to our learners. Their energy and focus can be directed towards learning the skills we teach rather than on getting familiar with data and concepts that are foreign to them. This strategy also increases the motivation of our learners. By learning how to solve problems that are familiar to them, they can more easily transpose these skills directly to their own data, and have a good starting point to continue their learning process as they try to solve new or more complex problems with their own data. 2.2.1 Identifying the practical skills Our primary aim in a Carpentries workshop is to increase the confidence of our learners. We want to demystify and make accessible the process of computing and analyzing data. More than a third of learners at our workshops have little to no coding experience (Jordan et al., 2018. Our workshops provide them an opportunity to try, in a friendly environment, something they perceive as intimidating. Another important goal is to make the research life of our learners easier. We emphasize teaching “good enough practices” (Wilson, et al., 2017) - concrete skills that are accessible, able to be adopted by researchers of any skill level, and likely to make an immediate positive impact on learners’ work. Teaching defensive programming, how to use spreadsheets effectively, or how to organize files consistently across research projects, are practical skills that can save a lot time when learners apply them in their own research. When developing a new curriculum, the first step is to identify the skills that will be the most immediately useful to learners and have the biggest impact on their work. This will vary a lot, so having a clear idea of your lesson’s intended audience is critical at this stage. Once you have identified these high-impact skills, the lesson content should be designed to create frequent opportunities for learners to practice these skills while exemplifying the tasks they perform in their daily work. Live coding and hands-on challenges that learners can directly relate to should allow them to project how they can start using the skills taught with their own data as soon as the workshop is over. Teaching the most useful skills in a practical way aims at encouraging continued learning after attending a workshop. Additionally, we have found that having local communities created by Instructors and learners, provides a resource and support group that fosters this culture of continuous learning. We will discuss in detail the process of identifying these core skills for your lesson in a later chapter. 2.2.2 Designing challenges to assess understanding 2.2.3 Planning the content of the lesson 2.3 Creating a narrative and selecting a dataset 2.4 Limitations of our approach We don’t teach Learners to be experts in 2 days, some of the complexity that comes with expertise can’t be part of our workshop. We do aim to set up the mental model of our Learners to allow them to grow into experts in the future. Managing this expectation is important because it limits demotivation. 2.5 The structure of our curriculum 2.5.1 The elements of The Carpentries curriculum 2.5.1.1 Episodes An episode is a single block of content and renders as a single page of a lesson website. Each episode teaches a set of related concepts (for example, navigating files and directories or indexing and subsetting data). It lists measurable learning objectives related to those concepts and contains a number of challenges to assess learners’ ability to perform those learning objectives. Episodes within a lesson can be dependent on earlier episodes and are generally taught in sequence. 2.5.1.2 Lesson A lesson is a collection of episodes that together help the learner to develop a particular set of competencies (for example, version control or data organization). Each lesson has a landing page that lists all its episodes as well as the overall learning objectives. The overall learning objectives for the lesson should be met by its episodes. Assessment of lesson-level learning outcomes is summative and can be addressed with a post-workshop survey. Lessons can be used independently and should not rely on concepts from other lessons. Lessons may have optional episodes, but lesson designers should provide a recommended structure or structures for what episodes should be taught together and in what order. 2.5.1.3 Curricula A curriculum is a set of lessons that together teach skills needed in a particular domain (for example, genomics or geospatial research). A curriculum has a landing page listing its component lessons and overall learning objectives, and describing the data used in the curriculum. Carpentries curricula often have a narrative structure, where lessons are explicitly linked in a sequence, for example, as steps in a data handling workflow. 2.5.1.4 Lesson Collections A lesson collection is the full set of lessons housed within a specific Lesson Program (for example, all Software Carpentry lessons), or within The Carpentries organization (including our Instructor Training and Trainer Training lessons). Lessons within a collection should match the target audience of the Lesson Program or the broader Carpentries community. 2.5.2 The I-We-You model Gradual release of responsibility Thinking aloud (I do) Provide scaffoding (We do) – think-pair-share, use this to identify misconceptions During the you do, move around, ask for their thinking aloud, listen to their thinking, identify misconceptions. Limitations teach to the mean. 2.6 Collaborative lesson design We transpose the model of open-source software development to collaborative lesson development. "],

What are the tools, libraries, packages that are typical of my domain? What is the life cycle of my data: How is the data transformed and analyzed from acquisition to publication and archival? As an expert in your field, there might be mutliple steps involved in your analysis that you have become so used to, that you might not recognize them as separate steps (expert blind spot, fluid representation). When designing the content of your lesson and curriculum, it is crucial that you identify these intermediate steps that will need to be taught to novices in the field. It is also however important when building the lesson to organize the content to put useful and applicable examples as early as possible. We have found that in the context of a 2-day workshop, starting with teaching how to generate high-quality plots before teaching about data types leads to more motivated learners than doing the opposite.

Clean-up (authors and staff) Put workshop page together We now have the alpha version of the lesson. (?) 7.1 Picking a dataset The dataset is a critical element of a Carpentries lesson. It needs to be chosen carefully and to meet the following criteria. Use a single dataset – Curricula are domain-specific and the same dataset should be used across all lessons that are part of the same curriculum. When developing a standalone lesson (one that is not part of a curriculum), we encourage you to choose a dataset that is already in use in one of our existing curricula. Although each lesson should use the same dataset, it is often appropriate to use variations of the core dataset for different lessons within a curriculum. For instance, the Data Carpentry lessons on data organization with spreadsheets use messy spreadsheets that have been created from the original dataset, but which introduce formatting issues to teach tidy data principles. Whenever possible, these derived datasets should be created using scripts rather than manually, so they can be regenerated if the original dataset changes. The dataset should be released under a CC0 license – Copyright laws and laws governing use and sharing of data and databases vary among countries. The Creative Commons Zero (CC0) license is designed to allow unrestricted use and sharing of data universally. The CC0 license allows the development of lessons around the dataset and modification of the dataset to suit our teaching needs. The dataset should be deposited in a public repository – All variations of the dataset that are used in the lesson should be deposited. The Carpentries deposits data for our lessons on figshare. If you choose another option, make sure the repository where the data is archived has the following features: a DOI link pointing to an overview of the dataset pre-registration of the DOI all files can be downloaded directly as an archive (e.g., zip file) with a persistent link each file can be downloaded directly with a persistent link the repository supports versioning The dataset should be real and represent what researchers in the field encounter – The datasets used as examples in the lessons should be based on real research datasets, and be of sufficient complexity that they are representative of the type of dataset that learners would encounter in their own research. Authors of the dataset should be identifiable, acknowledged, and there should be a link to the original source for the data – Even though the datasets we use in our lessons are released under a CC0 license, we acknowledge the authors of the dataset and link to the research projects based on the data we use. The dataset should be large enough – Analysing the dataset should represent a real challenge that highlights the power and usefulness of the tools covered in the lessons. The dataset should be larger than what would be easy to analyze and manipulate in a spreadsheet program. It should be similar in size to what researchers in that domain work with in their actual research. For instance, the core dataset for the Data Carpentry Ecology curriculum has ~35,000 rows. The dataset should be complex enough to ask interesting questions – Each observation should have at least 4-5 variables. These variables should be of a few different data types (at least continuous, discrete, integers, real numbers; and depending on the domain, may include more specialized data types such as date/time, GPS coordinates, unstructured text, etc.) The motivation for study and the protocol for data collection should be understable without much context – We have limited time in our workshops to cover the technical skills we want to teach. It should not take long to explain to learners what the data is about, how it was collected, and what types of interesting questions can be asked from it. The dataset should be relevant in different geographical and cultural contexts – Our workshops are taught to learners from diverse cultural and geographical backgrounds. The dataset should be understandable without much cultural context or pre-requiste knowledge needed to make it compelling. There should be clear and comprehensive metadata – The metadata should include a description of the data, explain what is included in each data field, how it was measured, and the unit in which it is reported. Overall, datasets used in Carpentries workshops should serve as examples of publicly deposited data suitable for research re-use. Learners should be able to use these datasets as examples and guides for their own research data that they would like to publish and make available to the broad scientific and academic community. 7.2 Formatting the dataset for teaching A possible challenge when using research datasets for teaching is that the dataset can include complexity that makes teaching more difficult by unnecessarily increasing learners’ cognitive load. While it is important for the dataset to provide an authentic experience for learners, it is often useful to simplify it or do some initial data cleaning and wrangling to make it easier for learners to focus on the core skills you are teaching. For instance, you may want to edit the dataset so that missing values are parsed appropriately. You may also want to remove data which leads to errors or warnings during parsing, columns with data types that are not relevant for the learning objectives of the workshops, or variables which require additional context to understand. When preparing a dataset for teaching, aim to find a balance between providing an authentic experience for learners while keeping complexity low to limit distractions from the learning objectives. Depending on the lesson’s goals, it might also be interesting to include several versions of the datasets that have undergone various levels of processing. At the beginning of the lesson, you can provide a clean and well organized dataset, while later you can introduce more complexity and teach learners how to handle it to generate the cleaner version of the data. Don’t introduce too many (no more than three) versions of the dataset in your lessons, as dealing with many files and remembering their differences can become challenging for the learners. 7.3 Overview Carpentries workshops last two full days. Generally workshops run from 9am to 5pm, with 30-minute breaks in the morning and in the afternoon, and an hour lunch break, leaving 6 hours for instruction. Carpentries lessons are therefore designed to be taught in 1.5, 3 or 6 hours. Having long and regular breaks are needed to pace the instruction, and allow learners to remain focused and engaged. Lessons are divided into episodes. Each episode should: be designed to last 15-30 minutes; limit cognitive load by introducing at most 7(\\(\\pm\\) 2) new concepts (3 to 5 concepts preferred); include at least one to three exercises that let learners practice the concepts covered in the episode. 7.4 Designing exercises Once the learning objectives for the lesson and each episode have been identified, you can start designing exercises that provide learners an opportunity to practice the skills outlined in the learning objectives. The Bloom taxonomy level of the learning objectives help frame how much information should be provided to the learners to be able to complete the exercise and the type of exercise. Writing the exercises before writing the content of the lesson ensures that the lesson will remain focused, and can reveal concepts needed to solve the exercises that were not previously considered. Starting with two to four exercises you want learners to be able to complete on their own at the end of the training, will help you identify the skills they need to acquire. Creating this list of skills will guide you in assembling your learning objectives. This list, in combination with the learners’ profiles, and the time you have available in your training, will help you identify the prerequisite skills for the audience of the workshop, and determine at which level of the Bloom taxonomy the learning objectives need to be written. This approach is “meet your learners where they are”. [FIXME: this paragraph might belong better to the learning objective section]. Identifying what the final exercises look like, and the skill they require, will also help you create the narrative for your lessons. The final exercises should be designed such that the learners can understand from the beginning of the lesson what they are working towards. The intermediate exercises can then be designed to build the skills and confidence learners need to be able to solve the final exercises. While lessons should include exercises that are direct applications of the skills covered in the instructions, at least half of the exercises should provide an opportunity for learners to integrate these new skills with skills covered earlier in the lesson. Learning is reinforced when Instructors explicitly point out how the skills seen in earlier parts of the lesson are being integrated to solve the exercises. Exercises in Carpentries lessons are a form of formative assessment. They help learners further their learning by having a chance to put into practice the skills being taught. They also help Instructors monitor the level of understanding in the classroom, and potentially catch misconceptions in the learner’s mental models that can be corrected early on. 7.5 The different types of exercises 7.5.1 Multiple Choice Questions Multiple choice questions can be an useful tool in formative assessment if the incorrect answers help you identify misconceptions. Designing MCQs with informative distractors takes time. It can also be challenging to identify useful distractors a priori (expert blindspot), appropriate answers for the MCQ may be prompted by teaching experience and may need to be refined. Don’t test for too many concepts at once. Ask learners if they came up with other solutions, or thought of other ways of approaching the problem (that end up not working). iris %&gt;% filter(Species == &quot;setosa&quot; &amp; Petal.Length &gt; 1.5) %&gt;% select(Species, Petal.Width) iris %&gt;% select(Species == &quot;setosa&quot; &amp; Petal.Length &gt; 1.5) %&gt;% filter(Species, Petal.Width) iris %&gt;% select(Species, Petal.Width) %&gt;% filter(Species == &quot;setosa&quot; &amp; Petal.Length &gt; 1.5) The distribution of the answers can also help you strategize how to address the misconceptions. 7.5.2 Parsons Problem 7.5.3 Fill in the blanks 7.5.4 Switch the dataset 7.5.5 Use the concept in a different context "],

The first draft (Pre-Alpha) of a lesson is usally written by an individual or a small group of people. From this first draft, the original authors organize a pilot workshop, and improve the content of the lessons based on the feedback from learners and co-instructors. They go through this iterative process a few times to bring the lesson where it is ready to be peer-reviewed by members of The Carpentries. After that, the lesson should be developed enough that people not involved in initial development efforts can teach it and contribute to it (Beta). After about six months in this stage, the lesson is mature enough and documented enough so that anyone interested can teach it and is officially released. The Pre-Alpha and Alpha development stages should focus on the content of the lesson: What to teach? How to teach it (which exercises, in which order should the concepts be introduced)? In the Beta stage, development efforts should focus on documenting the lesson, so that any Instructor familiar with the concepts covered in the lesson can understand the design of the lesson. 8.2.1 The blueprint (lesson proposal) If you have an idea for a lesson you think would be appropriate for The Carpentries, submit a proposal to the proposals repository in the Carpentries Lab organization following our template. The Curriculum Development Team will assess the fit of the proposed lesson, check for possible overlap with other efforts, and assign an Editor. If you have questions before submitting your proposal you may contact the Curriculum Development Team. The Curriculum Development Team and the Editor will work with you on your proposal. Once your proposal is accepted, we will publish the revised version of your proposal on The Carpentries websites. Community members who wish to join the proposal or support it in other ways will be able do so. The Editor for your lesson will provide guidance during the lesson development process, answer questions that may arise during the development, and coordinate the review process for your lesson. 8.2.2 The assembly (Early development, “Pre-Alpha”) We will create or transfer your repository to the GitHub Carpentries Lab organization where you will develop your lesson. We will provide you with our lesson template, and you will follow The Carpentries lesson development guidelines. During this initial development stage, your lesson will be in the “Pre-Alpha” stage. As lesson development progresses, you will report monthly to the Editor for your lesson. You will work with your handling Editor to set a date to teach the lesson for the first time. The Editor will provide general feedback on the content and structure of the lesson, and ensure that it is ready to be taught. 8.2.3 The sanding (field test, “Alpha”) Once the lesson is ready to be taught for the first time, it will enter the “Alpha” stage. Field-testing a lesson is a good opportunity to receive and incorporate feedback from learners, Instructors, and Developers who can compare their expectations to the reality. The initial feedback gathered during the first time a lesson is taught is really important. The Carpentries Assessment Team will work with you to develop surveys to gather feedback from your learners, helpers, and instructors. The Curriculum Development Team and the Editor for the lesson will review the feedback with you, and help you decide how to incorporate this feedback in your lesson. The Carpentries Community Manager will make an announcement that a new “Alpha” lesson is available to contribute to and can be taught by instructors interested in early-adoption of the lesson. These early workshops are also a good time for Instructors not involved in the development process to teach these lessons. They can provide a fresh perspective and useful feedback on the content of the lessons. After a few iterations of teaching and integrating feedback (and at least 2 early workshop pilots), you will let the Carpentries Editor know that your lesson is ready to be reviewed. The Editor will select 2-3 reviewers within The Carpentries community with teaching experience and/or appropriate domain expertise, who will provide an open and friendly review of the lesson. After incorporating feedback and comments from the reviewers, your lesson will be badged “Reviewed by the Carpentries Community” and will be listed on our websites as such. During this process, you will have the possibility to include a short paper describing your lesson in the GitHub repository and have your lesson considered for publication in JOSE, the Journal of Open Science Education. Once your lesson has gone through the peer-review process and has been approved by the Editor, we will create an official Zenodo release for it, and the lesson will enter the “Beta” stage. 8.2.4 The polishing (“Beta”) The “Beta” stage lasts approximately 6 months. During this time, members of The Carpentries community can teach it and contribute to the content of the lesson. Around the 4th month in this stage, you will organize a “Lesson Polishing” event (aka Bug BBQ). The main goal of this phase of the lesson development is to develop the documentation needed to ensure that people who have not contributed to the initial development efforts of the lesson have enough information to teach it effectively. After a final check from one of The Carpentries’ Editors, we will create a stable release for the lesson that will be listed on our website. Anyone in our community, including local Carpentries communities, will be able to use the lesson in their workshops or meetups. 8.2.5 The stable lesson T We will generate new releases every 6 months.

Tools used – Describe the software, packages, libraries that will be taught in the lesson. Make it clear if any of them are not open source licensed (i.e., they are not listed on the Open Source Initiative website). Suggestions for the dataset to use – review our dataset recommendations and describe the datasets you would like to use if it’s not one that is already in use in our lessons. A brief lesson outline – For each half day of material, please describe: 3–6 concrete learning objectives. An end-of-lesson assessment exercise to demonstrate the skills participants have learned. A summary of the tools and data set(s) that will be used. A point-form learning plan A brief comparison with existing open-access lessons on the subject. Evidence of need – Summarize evidence that researchers need this lesson. This summary may include links to online discussions (mailing lists, twitter, etc) or publications (e.g., descriptions of practices that are not yet widely adopted), results of surveys, etc. Development Team – Who are the people involved? Are they certified Carpentries instructors? What is their experience developing teaching materials in general and for the Carpentries in particular? Development Plan and Timeline – The development plan must include a timeline that makes specific people responsible for specific lesson modules, commitments from specific sites to teach trial versions of the lesson, a date and location for a hackathon (if appropriate), etc. We recognize that this plan may change as lesson development progress, but the more specific it is, the more credible the proposal will be. Support – Explain who will support lesson development and how. If you have secured funding, attach details. If you have not, but intend to seek it, describe any planned or submitted funding requests. If the work is not being funded, explain how development and delivery will be supported. A.2 For Grant-Supported lessons A.3 Transition to officially supported lesson "]
