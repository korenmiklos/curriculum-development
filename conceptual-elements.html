<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> The Carpentries mindset for curriculum development</h2>
<p>Carpentries curricula are developed based on the results of research in the science of
teaching and learning. We rely on findings synthesized in the book
<a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/How+Learning+Works%3A+Seven+Research+Based+Principles+for+Smart+Teaching-p-9780470484104">How Learning Works: Seven Research-Based Principles for Smart Teaching</a>
(Ambrose et al., 2010). We use this text in our Instructor Trainer training program, so that
Trainers (who teach our Instructor Training courses) can understand why we teach the way we
do, and why our lessons are designed the way they are.</p>
<p>The authors identify seven principles of learning (direct quotation from the book are bolded):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>âStudentsâ prior knowledge can help or hinder learning.â</strong> â Identifying
what the learners know before coming to our workshops help us adjust what we
teach. One way we do this is through <a href="https://carpentries.org/assessment/">our pre-workshop surveys</a>. We also give the learners
frequent exercises (or âchallengesâ) throughout our lessons, which help Instructors
and learners identify and correct misconceptions.</li>
<li><strong>âHow students organize knowledge influences how they learn and apply what
they know.â</strong> â Human working memory is limited, and can only handle about
five to seven separate items of information at a time. We organize our lessons
to introduce a few concepts at a time, and then provide challenges to give learners
an opportunity to practice using these new concepts. This lets learners build connections
between new concepts and their previous knowledge and transfer this new
knowledge into their long-term memory,
increasing the likelihood that they will be able to use this information successfully
in new contexts.</li>
<li><strong>âStudentsâ motivation determines, directs, and sustains what they do to
learn.â</strong> â Our learners come to our workshops already motivated to learn the concepts
we teach. They realize they need the skills we teach to conduct their
research more effectively. They have experienced the pain that comes with
copying and pasting data across spreadsheets, or having to re-do complex
graphs over and over as new data come in. However, they may also be
intimidated by how much they have to learn before being proficient
programmers and data analysts. Two strategies we use to keep our
learners motivated
are: (1) to create a positive learning environment, and (2) to teach the most
useful skills first. We teach <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/08-motivation/index.html">both of these in our Instructor Training program</a>,
and discuss how they influence curricular design below.</li>
<li><strong>âTo develop mastery, students must acquire component skills, practice
integrating them, and know when to apply what they have learned.â</strong> â
Our lessons use frequent challenges to provide
opportunities for learners to practice applying their new skills. These challenges
are designed to incrementally build on each other and integrate previous taught
and new skills. Careful attention to exercise design helps assure learners will
be able to transfer the
skills they acquire in our workshop to their own research.</li>
<li><strong>âGoal-directed practice coupled with targeted feedback enhances the quality
of studentsâ learning.â</strong> â When Learners try to solve the challenges we include in our
lessons, they receive direct feedback from the computer - either an
error message or the expected answer. Error messages are often opaque, and
do not on their own help learners advance in their learning process, making them
frustrating and demotivating. Our lessons are designed to be delivered as real-time
in-person instruction, so that learners get feedback from Instructors and workshop helpers
that is human-parsable and directed to their level of understanding. Furthermore,
challenges used in a lesson should only require the skills
that have already been introduced during the workshop, and should have a limited
range of possible answers.</li>
<li><strong>âStudentsâ current level of development interacts with the social,
emotional, and intellectual climate of the course to impact learning.â</strong> â Providing
a positive learning environment reduces learnersâ stress
and helps increase their confidence in their ability to use the skills we teach.
Creating this positive environment is a responsibility shared among all
participants: Instructors, helpers, workshop hosts, and learners.
Setting expectations by introducing
<a href="https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html">our Code of Conduct</a>
at the start of each workshop, and enforcing it,
contributes to making the workshop a welcoming space for everyone.
Other strategies we use to create a positive learning environment <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/08-motivation/index.html">are covered in our
Instructor Training</a>.
Curricular content also plays a major role in creating a positive environment:
examples chosen cannot be alienating, skill level must be appropriate for
the audience, and the examples and challenges must be directly applicable
for our learners. For instance, a learner
creates a visualization that they can directly apply to their own
data, it reinforces their motivation and favors a positive learning
climate.</li>
<li><strong>âTo become self-directed learners, students must learn to monitor and adjust
their approaches to learning.â</strong> â In-person workshops allow Instructors to
model the thinking process that is needed to address the challenges
in our lessons. As an Instructor, being very explicit (âthinking
aloudâ) about the steps of the mental model that are involved in identifying
the functions to use, the values of the arguments they take, and the order in
which to call these functions to solve an exercise, helps learners to think
of the questions they need to ask themselves when facing new problems to
solve. While this type of approach works for any level of complexity in the
challenges we teach, it works best for most advanced ones, where several steps
need to be integrated to come to the solution. Before reaching this level of
complexity, the challenges can be designed to guide this process, using
scaffolding. Scaffolding is the process where all the pieces of code to answer
the problem are already written but are not in the correct order (Parsonâs
problem), or fill in the blanks. This might be one of the most important
things we teach in our workshops. It sets learners on a successful path
for further self-directed learning. When developing the content of the curriculum, think of the
kind of thinking process that is needed to successfully address the research
questions in your field.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the context of a two-day workshop, not all of the principles outlined by the authors of âHow Learning Worksâ apply. We emphasize those that create a positive, engaging experience for our participants, and that will motivate them to learn more about the best practices and skills covered in our workshops.</p>
<p>Applying these principles effectively requires that they are incorporated into both
<strong>what</strong> is taught (content) and <strong>how</strong> it is taught (delivery). Our
Instructor Training program focuses on teaching Instructors how to use these principles
in their teaching. In this handbook, we focus on applying these principles to
curriculum design. Before starting to create lesson content, we hihgly recommend that you familiarize yourself with our <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/">Instructor Training curriculum</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="backward-design" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Backward design</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_design">Backward design</a> is an instructional
design model that starts with identifying the desired outcomes of a learning experience,
including core skills and concepts that learners need to acquire. These identified outcomes
are used to develop course content and assessments to measure learnersâ progress towards
these outcomes. This model was developed by Grant J. Wiggins and Jay McTighe in the late
1990s and is expanded on in their text
<a href="https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Wiggins-Understanding-by-Design-Expanded-Second-Edition-2nd-Edition/PGM229455.html">Understanding by Design</a>. We use backward design in developing our curricula because of its focus on identifying clear, measurable
learning goals and providing assessments aligned with those goals.</p>
<p>[Analogy with drawing: you want to draw the outline before filling the details.]</p>
<p>In essense, the backward design process has three stages:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Identify the practical skills we aim to teach.</li>
<li>Design challenges to give an opportunity for our learners to practice and
integrate these skills.</li>
<li>Identify what we need to teach for our learners to acquire these skills.</li>
</ol>
<p>This approach ensures that all the skills we teach work together to meet the over-arching
goals of our curriculum. It also reduces the risk that we wonât teach a concept learners
need in order to be able
to master the skills we aim to teach. Similarly, it avoids teaching topics that do not help us meet our goals.</p>
<p>Reducing distractions is part of our lesson design as we strive to reduce cognitive load on learners. To this end, we also develop our lessons to be centered around a narrative and a dataset they can relate with quickly.</p>
<p>Because our workshops are domain-specific, the data we use, and the type of questions we ask
with the data are already somewhat familiar to our learners. Their energy and focus can be
directed towards learning the skills we teach rather than on getting familiar with data and
concepts that are foreign to them. This strategy also increases the motivation of our
learners. By learning how to solve problems that are familiar to them, they can more easily
transpose these skills directly to their own data, and have a good starting point to
continue their learning process as they try to solve new or more complex problems with their
own data.</p>

<p>Our primary aim in a Carpentries workshop is to increase the confidence of our learners. We
want to demystify and make accessible the process of computing and analyzing data. More than
a third of learners at our workshops have little to no coding experience <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1325464#.XF39ts9Kjw4">(Jordan et al., 2018</a>. Our workshops provide them an
opportunity to try, in a friendly environment, something they perceive as intimidating.</p>
<p>Another important goal is to make the research life of our learners easier. We emphasize
teaching âgood enough practicesâ <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510">(Wilson, et al., 2017)</a> -
concrete skills that are accessible, able to be adopted by researchers of any skill level,
and likely to make an immediate positive impact on learnersâ work. Teaching defensive
programming, how to use spreadsheets effectively, or how to organize files consistently
across research projects, are practical skills that can save a lot time when learners apply
them in their own research.</p>
<p>When developing a new curriculum, the first step is to identify the skills that will be the
most immediately useful to learners and have the biggest impact on their work. This will
vary a lot, so having a clear idea of your lessonâs intended audience is critical at this
stage.</p>
<p>Once you have identified these high-impact skills, the lesson content should be designed to
create frequent opportunities for learners to practice these skills while exemplifying the
tasks they perform in their daily work. Live coding and hands-on challenges that learners
can directly relate to should allow them to project how they can start using the skills
taught with their own data as soon as the workshop is over.</p>
<p>Teaching the most useful skills in a practical way aims at encouraging continued learning
after attending a workshop. Additionally, we have found that having local communities
created by Instructors and learners, provides a resource and support group that fosters this
culture of continuous learning.</p>
<p>We will discuss in detail the process of identifying these core skills for your lesson
in <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/curriculum-development/how-to-decide-what-to-teach.html">a later chapter</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>We donât teach Learners to be experts in 2 days, some of the complexity that
comes with expertise canât be part of our workshop. We do aim to set up the
mental model of our Learners to allow them to grow into experts in the future.
Managing this expectation is important because it limits demotivation.</li>

<div id="episodes" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.5.1.1</span> Episodes</h4>
<p>An episode is a single block of content and renders as a single page of a lesson website.
Each episode teaches a set of related concepts (for example,
<a href="http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/02-filedir/index.html">navigating files and directories</a>
or <a href="https://datacarpentry.org/python-ecology-lesson/03-index-slice-subset/index.html">indexing and subsetting data</a>).
It lists measurable learning objectives related to those concepts
and contains a number of challenges to assess
learnersâ ability to perform those learning objectives. Episodes within a lesson can be
dependent on earlier episodes and are generally taught in sequence.</p>
</div>
<div id="lesson" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.5.1.2</span> Lesson</h4>
<p>A lesson is a collection of episodes that together help the learner to develop a particular
set of competencies
(for example, <a href="http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/">version control</a> or
<a href="http://www.datacarpentry.org/spreadsheets-socialsci/">data organization</a>).
Each lesson has a landing page that lists all its episodes as well
as the overall learning objectives. The overall learning objectives for the lesson
should be met by its episodes. Assessment of lesson-level learning outcomes is summative and
can be addressed with a post-workshop survey. Lessons can be used independently and should
not rely on concepts from other lessons. Lessons may have optional episodes, but lesson
designers should provide a recommended structure or structures for what episodes should
be taught together and in what order.</p>
</div>
<div id="curricula" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.5.1.3</span> Curricula</h4>
<p>A curriculum is a set of lessons that together teach skills needed in a particular
domain (for example, <a href="https://datacarpentry.org/genomics-workshop/">genomics</a> or
<a href="https://datacarpentry.org/geospatial-workshop/">geospatial research</a>). A curriculum has a
landing page listing its component lessons and overall learning objectives, and describing
the data used in the curriculum. Carpentries curricula often have a narrative structure,
where lessons are explicitly linked in a sequence, for example, as steps in a data handling
workflow.</p>
</div>
<div id="lesson-collections" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.5.1.4</span> Lesson Collections</h4>
<p>A lesson collection is the full set of lessons housed within
a specific Lesson Program (for example, all <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/">Software Carpentry lessons</a>), or
within The Carpentries organization (including our <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/">Instructor Training</a> and
<a href="https://carpentries.github.io/trainer-training/">Trainer Training</a> lessons).
Lessons within a collection should match the target audience of the Lesson Program or
the broader Carpentries community.</p>
